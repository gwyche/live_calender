### Version 1

This early version has routerlinks and all the necessary services written. It just needs more business logic to intake appointments and send them to the MonthService, which oversees all of the days, so that that object can influence the styling on the calender based upon what the current day is, whether an appointment is scheduled for a given day, and whether the appointment time is drawing near, given the expected travel time. Everything should be up and running in a few days.
